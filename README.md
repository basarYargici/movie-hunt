##  Tech stack & Open-source libraries

- 100%  [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)  based +  [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)  +  [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/)  for asynchronous.
- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€

- [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way  
  and act as a channel between use cases and ui
- [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Support library that generates a _binding class_ for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout. In most cases, view binding replaces  `findViewById`.
- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) Navigation component is the API and the design tool in Android Studio that makes it much easier to create and edit navigation flows throughout your application.

- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dependency injection library for Android
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type safe http client  
  and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/moshi) - JSON Parser
- [okhttp-logging-interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Concurrency design pattern for asynchronous programming.

## Download

1. Clone the repo
2. Generate a new API Key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). We will use this key in each request.
3. Follow the YouTube Android Player API documentation : Download jar and generate API Key
4. Go to `gradle.properties` file and create and bind your keys to IMDB API Key and Youtube API Key :
 ```kotlinAPI_KEY="0d******************v32" YOUTUBE_API_KEY="I8Y*************************8J"  
```  
6. Add keys to `gradle.properties` :
 ```kotlinbuildConfigField 'String', 'API_KEY', API_KEY buildConfigField 'String', 'YOUTUBE_API_KEY', YOUTUBE_API_KEY  
```  
7. Gradle Sync
